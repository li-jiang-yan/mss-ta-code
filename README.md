# Modeling Space and Systems Code
This repository contains the code that I programmed for being a teaching assistant for Modeling Space and Systems.

1. template_placer.py is a Python script used to transfer the scores from a compiled Excel sheet and organize them into a template suitable for instructor uploading onto Blackboard.
2. mss_piazza.py is a Python script used to gather all posts and post numbers from a Piazza class.
